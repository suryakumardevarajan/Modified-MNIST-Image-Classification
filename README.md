# Modified MNIST Image Classification?

#### COMP 551 [project 3](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject3_spec.pdf )

In this project we explore the performance of various deep learning models for classifying the images in the Modified MNIST dataset
Google Colab
We used Google Colab to run the files. 

# Project structure
The project is structured as follows -
1. **data** contains the images distributed into train and test subfolders.
2. **output** containing the final exported csv, with predictions from our best model.
3. **src** contains the source code of the project, consisting of the following files
a. **Group51_Modified_MNIST.ipynb**- analyses of the data and execution of models.
b. Loaded Weights file for each of the models

# Running
1. Execute models and analyses:
'jupyter notebook .' in Google Colab
The files in the data folder need to be uploaded first to the root folder of Colab before running the notebook. Our implementation doesnâ€™t require any additional packages. All packages used by us come out of the box with Google Colab.
